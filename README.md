# RCProxy
A lightweight inapp HTTP requests logger for your iOS and tvOS apps.

Available with SPM.

## How to use it
In AppDelegate, just write `RCProxy.start()`.
When you want to show the interface, just use `RCProxy.show(in: UIViewController)`.
If you want to present the viewController in a different way, you can simply get the instance with `RCProxy.viewController`.
